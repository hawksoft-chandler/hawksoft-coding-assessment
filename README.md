# HawkSoft Coding Assignment

## Introduction

I first noticed that this was dated 4/1/2020, wondering if this was a joke or not.

There is no way that I could do all of this in 3 hours and ever feel good about what I had done...

That being said, I could have spent much more time working on this, but did what I could with the limited time that my life has allowed me in these past few days.

As discussed previously with Matt, I did not attempt the UI segment of this project.

## Setup and Build

---

If you have Docker Desktop installed you can run `docker-compose up` from the root of the project. This will create a mongo container and populate it with some mock data. A file named `.env` can be found in the root of the project containing the port of the api (API_PORT) and the port of the mongo database(MONGO_PORT). Please assign these values as needed per your machine.
